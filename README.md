                 Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! - The Console 

## Project Description
This is the first phase of a four phase project, to create a basic clone of the AirBnB web app. In this first phase a basic console was created using the Cmd Python module, to manage the objects of the whole project, being able to implement the methods create, show, update, all, and destroy to the existing classes and subclasses.

## Description Command Interpreter
A command interpreter is the part of a computer operating system that understands and executes commands that are entered interactively by a human being or from a program.
The Command Interpreter is used to manage the whole application's functionality from the command line, such as:

-   Crete a new object.
-   Retrieve an object from a file, database, etc.
-   Execute operation on objects. e.g. Count, compute statistics, etc.
-   Update object's attributes.
-   Destroy an object.

# Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/shady-cj/AirBnB_clone.git
cd AirBnB_clone
```

# How to use the interpreter?
```shell
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
